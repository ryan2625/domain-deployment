My updated [personal portfolio](https://ryan-dev.com/). This is my third attempt at creating a personal portfolio page. I used [Shape Divider](https://www.shapedivider.app/) to create the SVG curves separating the sections and [Haikei](https://app.haikei.app/) to create the other 
SVGs seen on the webpage. I used the javascript library [Kute](https://thednp.github.io/kute.js/) to handle the SVG animations.

Tech used: HTML, JQuery, CSS

Domain purchased via Hostinger.
